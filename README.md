- Issues report for products needing manual attention

from client import CatalogEnrichmentClient

client = CatalogEnrichmentClient()
result = client.enrich(
    products=[{"id":"P1","name":"Vitamin C Serum","price":35,"description":"","category":"","tags":[],"images":[]}],
)
print(result["catalog_health"])
for p in result["enriched_products"]:
    print(f"{p['name']}: {p['_completeness_score']}% complete | Changes: {p['_changes_made']}")
```
